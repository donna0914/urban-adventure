    <h2>CAPSTONE Initiative</h2>
    <p>Our research idea is all about the EFFECTS OF DIFFICULTY LEVEL ON THE ADAPTABILITY LEVEL OF THE SELECTED SENIOR HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS LIVING IN DORMS. Nowadays, many students who live far away from home choose dormitory life because of the convenience of going to school. Living in a dormitory provides them with the flexibility to manage their schedules effectively, allowing them to spend more time on academic pursuits instead of wasting it on daily commutes. While many students find this arrangement beneficial, some students struggle with time management and face psychological challenges associated with extended stays. Therefore, the researchers proposed developing a website called "AbouTime" to help students optimize their time and address mental health issues. The platform is designed to provide features for efficient time organization and promote mental clarity and stress relief.</p>
   
    <h3>Below is the abstract of our CAPSTONE</h3>

    <p>Living in a dormitory, while beneficial for students, may impose some difficulties in their ability to adapt or the difficulty level in balancing their academic and living responsibilities. As a result, this research will investigate the effect of the difficulty level on the adaptability level of senior high school students of De La Salle Lipa living in a dormitory. The purpose of this study is to aid the concerns that students living in dormitories often encounterâ€“ this includes distractions in the dormitories, difficulty balancing personal and academic aspects of their life, lack of time and energy to accomplish schoolworks after cleaning up in the dormitory, and much more. Moreover, a Sequential Explanatory research design will be utilized throughout this mixed-methods study to ensure the validity of the results. After thirty (30) carefully-chosen respondents are attained from a purposive sampling, they will be subjected into answering a 4-point likert scale survey, and then 10 respondents from the total will be interviewed for the collection of the qualitative data. The quantitative data collected from the surveys will be analyzed using Mean and Linear Regression Analysis. Meanwhile, the qualitative data will go through the process of Glaserian Coding. All relative data will be organized and tabulated in order to ensure a proper analysis of the data, which will then result in better accuracy of the results. This will enable the researchers to know what to apply and what to improve in the interactive scheduling website, that aims to assist students in their daily dormitory and academic life, called AbouTime.</p>

    <h1>Reflections</h1>
    <p>Developing my webpage portfolio was an eye-opening experience where I learned to combine artistic expression with technical skills. Through research, I grasped the significance of reliable sources and accurate information to maintain credibility. Coding became a tool that allowed me to translate my ideas into a digital reality, enhancing both my creativity and problem-solving abilities. Peer and teacher feedback were invaluable in refining my work, teaching me to accept criticism constructively. Collaborating with others taught me the importance of communication and teamwork in achieving a common goal. This project not only improved my digital literacy but also instilled in me a sense of pride and accomplishment in showcasing my work. As a Grade 12 HUMSS student, this endeavor broadened my understanding of digital communication and presentation, preparing me for future endeavors in both academia and beyond.</p>
